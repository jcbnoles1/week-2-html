    El Camino: A Breaking Bad Movie (or simply El Camino) is a 2019 
    
    <span style="background-color: green;">American</span>
    
    neo-Western crime thriller film. Part of the Breaking Bad franchise, 
    it serves as a sequel and epilogue to the television series Breaking Bad. It continues the story of Jesse Pinkman, who partnered with former 
    teacher Walter White throughout the series to build a crystal meth empire based in Albuquerque. Series creator Vince Gilligan wrote, directed, 
    and produced El Camino; Aaron Paul reprised his role as Jesse Pinkman. Several actors involved in Breaking Bad also reprised their roles, 
    including Jesse Plemons, Krysten Ritter, Charles Baker, Matt Jones, Robert Forster, Jonathan Banks, and Bryan Cranston. Forster died on the day 
    of El Camino's release, making the film one of his final on-screen appearances.</p>

<p style="background-color: lightgreen;padding: 15px;border-radius: 10px;"> Gilligan began considering the story of El Camino while writing Breaking Bad's series finale. He approached Paul with the idea for the film in 2017, 
    near the tenth anniversary of the show's premiere, and completed the script several months later. Principal photography began in secret in New Mexico in 
    November 2018, lasting nearly 50 days. The project remained unconfirmed until Netflix released a trailer on August 24, 2019.</p>

<p style="color: red;background-color: aqua;">El Camino received a digital release on Netflix and a limited theatrical run on October 11, 2019, with an AMC television premiere on February 16, 2020. 
    It drew positive reviews from critics, who praised the performances of Paul and Plemons, as well as Gilligan's direction. The film garnered several award 
    nominations, winning Best Movie Made for Television at the Critics' Choice Television Awards and Best Motion Picture Made for Television at the Satellite Awards. 
    El Camino additionally gained four nominations at the Primetime Creative Arts Emmy Awards for Outstanding Television Movie and other technical categories.</p>

    <p style="border: 1px solid black;border-radius: 50px; background-color: lightgray;padding: 15px;">The siege of Calais (4 September 1346 – 3 August 1347) occurred at the conclusion of the Crécy campaign, when an English army under the command of King Edward III 
    of England successfully besieged the French town of Calais during the Edwardian phase of the Hundred Years' War.</p>


    <p style="border: 2px solid red; background-color: aliceblue;">The English army of some 10,000 men had landed in northern Normandy on 12 July 1346. They embarked on a large-scale raid, or chevauchée, devastating large parts 
        of northern France. On 26 August 1346, fighting on ground of their own choosing, the English inflicted a heavy defeat on a large French army led by their king 
        Philip VI at the Battle of Crécy. A week later they invested the well-fortified port of Calais, which had a strong garrison under the command of Jean de Vienne. 
        Edward made several unsuccessful attempts to breach the walls or to take the town by assault, either from the land or seaward sides. During the winter and spring 
        the French were able to run in supplies and reinforcements by sea, but in late April the English established a fortification which enabled them to command the entrance 
        to the harbour and cut off the further flow of supplies.</p>
